Sample query:

/* list vulnerabilities discovered for oracle solaris 11.3 */

select a.cve_id, pub_datetime, summary, cwe_id,
cvss_score, cvss_access_vector, cvss_access_complexity, cvss_authentication,
cvss_confidential_impact, cvss_integrity_impact, cvss_availability_impact
from pa_vulnerable_prod a, pa_vulnerability_cve b
where a.cve_id=b.cve_id and cpe_id like '%:oracle:solaris:11.3%' and pub_datetime > '20151231';

TIPS: The above information is sufficient to calculate CVSS score for your environment. 
      For more informaiton google CVSS v3 or CVSS calculator.
